# ProjectOSRS
A project to port all or most of OSRS items to a Total Miner: Forge mod.

# Building
**Downloading the sprites for this mod can be time consuming, so you can get a file cache to place in your `bin/Debug` or `bin/Release` from [here](https://mega.nz/#!tn5QXDDD!16m1jjyEDxCXmjhp2lqy19kwcxPm2EHWtSabt0--nEE)**

Before running, you must place a (osrs.me item schema copy)[https://github.com/justync7/osrs.me/raw/master/data/raw/items.json] in the `bin/Debug` folder for OSRStoTMF.
To build this mod you have to run the OSRStoTMF command line program to generate the XML and spritesheet, then build  the solution again to copy all the needed files to `ProjectOSRS/Install`.
